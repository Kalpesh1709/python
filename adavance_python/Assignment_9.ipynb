The data is handled exactly as it is, without any translation of line endings.\n","\n","Text-Mode: You can specify an encoding (e.g., open('file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8')), and Python handles the conversion between the file's byte data and the string data in your program.\n","\n","Binary-Mode: Encoding is not applicable in binary mode because you're working directly with bytes, not text.\n","\n","Text-Mode: Python translates line endings automatically. For example, when writing, it converts \\n to the appropriate line ending for your operating system.\n","\n","Binary-Mode: Line endings are not modified; they are treated as part of the data and are written exactly as provided."],"metadata":{"id":"mIdpMD36HqTD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q5.
