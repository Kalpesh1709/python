Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xVvydl0xK4Dh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Ans:**\n","\n","text files store human-readable characters, while binary files contain data in a binary format, making them unreadable without specialized software. Text files use encodings like ASCII, whereas binary files can store any type of data, such as images or executables, more compactly."],"metadata":{"id":"4aR2Myu_LgjY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.

When would you like to use binary files instead of text files?**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cO38XHOdK7xF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Ans:**\n","\n","**Scenarios for Using Text Files:**\n","- **Configuration Files**: When you need a file that's easy for humans to read and edit, like settings for software.\n","- **Log Files**: Storing logs for debugging or monitoring, where readability is important.\n","- **Data Serialization**: Simple data formats like CSV or JSON, which need to be shared or edited across different systems.\n","\n","**Scenarios for Using Binary Files:**\n","- **Multimedia Files**: Storing images, videos, or audio, where efficiency and compactness are crucial.\n","- **Executable Files**: Compiled programs or machine code, which need to be executed by a computer.\n","- **Large Datasets**: When performance is critical, and you need to store and access large amounts of data quickly, such as in databases or scientific computing."],"metadata":{"id":"GePTltsoMK1N"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q3.
