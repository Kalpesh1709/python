What is a probability distribution, exactly?

It provides the probabilities of different outcomes for that variable.\n","\n","- **Discrete Probability Distribution**: Lists probabilities for each possible value (e.g., rolling a die).\n","- **Continuous Probability Distribution**: Describes probabilities over a range of values using a probability density function (e.g., heights of people).\n","\n","While individual outcomes are random, the distribution provides a model for predicting the likelihood of various outcomes, allowing for statistical predictions and analysis."],"metadata":{"id":"lmVG7AJjetGl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.
