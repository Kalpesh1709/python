It lets you run code that might cause an error, and if an error happens, you can catch and manage it without crashing the program. The try block contains the risky code, and the except block defines what to do if an error occurs. You can also use finally to ensure certain code runs no matter what, like closing a file."],"metadata":{"id":"dM4Qbo3yFVEN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.
