List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.\n","\n","2. List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all even numbers in range of 100, we can write [n for n in range(100) if n%2 == 0]. There is no alternate for it in map\n","\n","3. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list.\n","\n","4. List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express\n","\n","5.
